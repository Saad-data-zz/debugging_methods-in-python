## List of Error/ Problems:
- Describe the Problem:
You must have to understand the problem before your going to look for solution. 
Try to make a sence of the problem in steps. But it's really important to understand the problem. Best option is to divide a bigger problem into small problems.
Look for problem 1.1 in main.py code file.

-  Reproduce the Bug:
The bug which might not shown up on first run but they will appear after running the code again and again.
For such kind of bug first make your code able to reproduced the error on every run. And when you understand the error and reason try to solve it.
Look for problem in 1.2 in main.py code file.

- Play Computer:
This means that you have to put yourself in the place of computer and think like a computer. Visualise the problem like computer like how the computer actually take up the problem.
look for problem 1.3 in main.py code file.

-  Fix the Error:
There some error which are highlighted in the console like they're red underlined. This type of error are easy to solve becasue you exactly know where is the error. But sometimes even if you fix the error the output is not according to the requirement. That's quite frustrating. In such situation
only you can rely on your coding skills which helps you to identify the problem and get through the solution. So all you need is practice the code and join the platform to overcome the error helping other will also increase your coding ability.
Look for problem 1.4 in main.py code file.

- Print is your Friend:
The print function is your real friend. HOW? because you can print anything at anywhere in the program and see what actually going on inside the code.
Look for problem 1.5 in main.py code file.

- Use a Debugger:
The debugger will help to identifying coding errors at various stages of the operating system.
Look for problem 1.6 in main.py code file

- Take a Break:
It's really important to take a break and have cup coffee or tea or watch something.
And come break to code. It's really helps and able to get through the problem.

- Ask your Friend:
If you relly stuck into the problem and you followed all the above steps to solve the problem. But still unable to get through then ask your friend fro help. 

- Run Offen:
This means that try to run your code in small part. And when the samll part works after that run together.

- Ask Stack Overflow:
Goto https://stackoverflow.com/ and type your problem there or ask a question.

There are some more debugging code examples in the main.py code file. Try to run and practice your debugging skills.
